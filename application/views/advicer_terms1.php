					<p>This Clause 25 may be referred to as the parties’<strong> “Dispute Resolution Agreement.” If you have a dispute with www.bestadvicer.com or if www.bestadvicer.com has a dispute with you and such dispute cannot be resolved informally, such dispute will be resolved on an individual basis in accordance with the provisions set forth below:  </strong></p>
					<p> <strong> (a) Informal Resolution. </strong>  Prior to initiating mediation or arbitration, the party with a grievance must: </p>
					<p> (1) Notify the other party, in writing, of the facts of the dispute and all damages claimed. Such a writing must be sent to (a) the Expert’s email address on file with www.bestadvicer.com, or (b) Successtainment Pvt. Ltd. Registered Address, or info@www.bestadvicer.com , whichever is applicable (“Dispute Notification”). </p>
					<p>(2) The party receiving the Dispute Notification has thirty (30) days from receipt of the Dispute Notification to respond.  </p>
					<p> (3) The other party then has 15 days to reply to the response. </p>
					<p> <strong> (b) Mediation. </strong> If the dispute is not resolved informally, either party may make a demand for mediation, with the other party’s consent. If either party requests mediation and both parties consent to mediation, the costs of mediation will be borne equally by the parties. </p>
					<p> <strong>(c) Arbitration. </strong>
(i) Mutual agreement to arbitrate. If mediation does not occur or if mediation does not resolve the dispute, then both parties agree that all disputes between them, including without limitation, those disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Services provided under this Agreement, the termination of this Agreement, the use of the Site, and the “Terms” as defined in the Agreement, shall be determined exclusively by final and binding arbitration before a single, neutral arbitrator as described herein.
 </p>
 <p>(ii) Covered claims. Claims subject to arbitration under this Dispute Resolution Agreement include, but are not limited to, the following types of claims between and among Expert on the one hand, and www.bestadvicer.com, its subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, benefit plans, or agents, any alleged joint employers, and any of www.bestadvicer.com Users (including Customers and Experts), on the other hand: breach of contract; discrimination, harassment, or retaliation; wrongful discharge; negligence or other tort claims including defamation, libel, slander, fraud, invasion of privacy, and infliction of emotional distress; claims for other compensation; and all other statutory, regulatory, contractual, or tort claims or claims of violation of any international, Union/national, state/provincial, or local statute, ordinance, governmental enactment, common law duty, provision, or doctrine. Except as provided below, the parties voluntarily waive all rights to trial in court before a judge on claims between them. Judgment upon the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The only disputes and actions excluded from this Dispute Resolution Agreement are: (a) actions to enforce this Dispute Resolution Agreement, compel arbitration, or claims by either party seeking temporary injunctive relief prior to the appointment of the arbitrator; and (b) claims for which this Dispute Resolution Agreement would be invalid as a matter of law. Individual knowingly and voluntarily waives the right to file or seek relief in a court seeking recovery of money damages.  </p>
 <p>(iii) Arbitration rules and selection of arbitrator.  (Laws applicable should be mentioned here).                             The parties shall have 30 days from receipt of a notice of arbitration to select a mutually agreeable arbitrator. If the parties are unable to jointly select the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be selected as provided in the AAA’s rules.  </p>
 <p>(iv) Commencement of arbitration and location of hearing. A party wishing to initiate arbitration must notify the other party in writing by hand delivery or certified mail. The notice must identify the party requesting the arbitration, and it must describe the facts upon which the claim is based, the date and location of any occurrences giving rise to the claim, and the remedy requested. Notice must be sent to the Expert’s email address on file with www.bestadvicer.com, or Registered Address of Successtainment Pvt. Ltd. or info@www.bestadvicer.com . The arbitration hearing shall be held in Mathura or Delhi.  </p>
 <p> (v) The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant rules subject to the following modifications: </p>
 <p> (vi) Authority of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the same authority to order remedies to individual claimants as would a court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall also have the same authority to decide dispositive motions as would a court, though he or she may establish appropriate and less formal procedures for such motions consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration proceedings. The arbitrator shall have the authority to issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses at the arbitration hearing and to compel the production of documents during discovery. Except as provided below, the arbitrator shall have the authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Dispute Resolution Agreement, including without limitation any claim that the Dispute Resolution Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall not have the authority to hear disputes not recognized by existing law and shall dismiss such claims upon motion by either party in accordance with the standards and burdens generally applicable in federal district court. </p>
 <p> (vii) Governing law applicable to this Dispute Resolution Agreement. The parties acknowledge that clause 25 contains the parties' "Dispute Resolution Agreement"; that this Dispute Resolution Agreement is made in the course of interstate commerce; that any arbitration under this Dispute Resolution Agreement is governed by the (Applicable Laws should be mentioned). This choice of law provision applies only to this Dispute Resolution Agreement, and not to the rest of this Agreement or Terms. </p>
 <p> (viii) Lawyer’s fees; survival; and right to consult. The arbitrator shall award Lawyer’s fees and costs to the prevailing party in any arbitration arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Terms, and where otherwise provided by applicable law.
